CardioAr allows learners to interact immersively with 3D assets, gifs, and User Interfaces of the human heart.  Learners get to immerse themselves in this AR scene hence giving them a different experience from the  the traditional way of learning.

## Inspiration
Over a month, our team lead found great interest in the YouTube channel Our History. The channel has a subchannel called, Autopsy, where doctors talk about why some famous stars suddenly die.
He noticed a trend in about 99% of the autopsy reports that most of them die from cardiac arrest or respiratory issues due to unhealthy lifestyles like excessive smoking and snouting of illegal drugs, overworking, lack of sleep, and alcohol abuse.
This was a popular trend in the 90's for stars.;
The moment you become a star ðŸŒŸ , you need to have a cigar ðŸš¬ . 
This was part of their costume because by then, the contemporaries of that period did not know about the adverse effects of smoking.

It was this that inspired him to get us to work on CardioAR to help inform/educate people about the heart and lungs as these organs are vital to our well-being and can cause serious health issues 
when not cared for.

## What it does
CardioAr allows learners to interact immersively with 3D assets, gifs, and User Interfaces of the human heart. 
Learners get to immerse themselves in this AR scene hence giving them a different experience from the 
the traditional way of learning.

## How we built it
We built CardioAR using Adobe Aero for arranging/placing the 3D models and other assets in the scene and creating the interactions for the User interfaces that were created in Figma.

We initially designed the User interfaces in Figma, downloaded some free 3D models from Sketchfab, some gifs from makegif.com and free audio files from Wikipedia, and and some images from pexels.com and maxhealthcare.com.

We then created a folder for each asset and uploaded them into the Adobe Aero environment.
Then we placed the assets in the desired locations in the scene. After a series of tries and errors with the placements of the assets, we later used the interactivity feature in Aero to add interactions to the assets; hiding and showing some of the assets on start and on click events; playing a heartbeat sound when the heart is shown beating, invoke the gifs of the heart and respiratory system to play when the corresponding annotation is clicked and display the UI describing the chambers of the heart when the annotation on the heart is/ are clicked.

Also, to inform the user that an annotation is clickable and will display a piece of hidden information, we make the hotspots/annotations bounce infinitely so it can draw the attention of users.

Moreover, users can display all the assets in the scene when the laptop hotspot is clicked and can hide them by clicking on Zara( the animated female character in the scene).

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into file size limitations and found the desired 3D model, audio file, and gifs for our project.
From reading about AR, we noticed that projects created in Adobe Aero, work best under 50 MB ( file size) hence giving users a great experience. 
So we had to do some compression and also limit the number of 3D models in the scene.

Also, looking at the short time left for us, we had to work with a few annotations of the heart just so we could work on other parts of the project.

To add to the above, sometimes position and the placement of the assets in the scene is daunting because, if you don't look at the various angles to place your assets, the position might be wrong.
For example, just looking at the front view of an asstes might appear to be closer but upon looking at it from a side view, top view etc, you'd notice it could be way off the desired location.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we finished this project within two days and are well-positioned about what we've produced.

## What we learned
We learned about teamwork and shared responsibilities in that since two of the team members were writing exams and given the 2 days we got to know about this hackathon, we were able to deliver on our assigned roles in the hackathon.

## What's next for CardioAR
We plan on adding interactive quizzes including that of Google Forms so learners can be graded via some questions created in Google Forms. 
Also, we plan on adding new 3D models of the lungs and heart (a healthy and diseased heart and lungs) to the project to educate learners about the adverse effects of unhealthy lifestyles on the hearts and lungs.
Furthermore, adding more annotations to the heart is something interesting to add in the future.

Moreover, to scale, if Aero crashes when the file size is large, we will look forward to working on a similar project in Unity or Google's model viewer or leveraging the power of three.js.
